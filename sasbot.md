# SASbot/1.0

SASbot is the name of the web crawler used by [Wepublic](https://wepublic.nl) to scrape political news across the web. We might access your website once every few minutes to check whether you've published something new that's relevant to us or our clients.

## I don't want to be scraped!
Although it's quite almost impossible not to have your website scraped by anyone, there are some general guidelines you can follow.

1. Send us a message at [stakeholderintelligence@wepublic.nl](mailto:stakeholderintelligence@wepublic.nl) and ask us to exclude your site from our scraper.
2. Google has a great tutorial on how a [robots.txt](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062596?hl=en) file works. You can setup such a file to prevent your website from being scraped by most organisations.
3. There are also [some more extreme measures](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062607?visit_id=637195319077206224-1644527464&rd=1) you can take to prevent your site from being scraped.
